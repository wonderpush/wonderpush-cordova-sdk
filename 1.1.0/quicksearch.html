High volume and fast delivery. Start for free. This a Cordova / PhoneGap SDK. Quick links: Getting started guide Latest SDK documentation Latest API reference Demo application Getting startedPlease see our guide for more information. 1) Create your application if neededUse cordova tool to create an application, see the official Cordova guide for more details. cordova create cordova-demo com.wonderpush.demo WonderPushCordovaDemo cd cordova-demoAdd the Android and iOS platforms: cordova platform add android --save cordova platform add ios --save2) Add the WonderPush SDKcordova plugin add --save wonderpush-cordova-sdk --variable CLIENT_ID='id' --variable CLIENT_SECRET='secret'For development: cordova plugin add --save --link ../wonderpush-cordova-sdk --variable CLIENT_ID='id' --variable CLIENT_SECRET='secret'3) Configure your platformsa) For iOS: Add the Push Notifications capabilityIf you've just created your project, before we open XCode, make sure to build the project once so that things like Signing identities are properly set: cordova buildFirst, let's add the new application extension to your project: Open platforms/ios/YourApplication.xcworkspace in XCode. In the Project navigator, select your project. Select your application target. In the Capabilities tab, flip the Push Notifications switch on. This step could not be done automatically without causing problems building the Notification Service Extension with Cordova of the next step. b) For iOS: (Recommended) Support rich notificationsIn order to use rich notifications on iOS, you must add a Notification Service Extension to your project and let the WonderPush SDK do the hard work for you. First, let's add the new application extension to your project: Open platforms/ios/YourApplication.xcworkspace in XCode. Open the XCode File menu, under New select Target…. In the iOS tab, in the Application Extension group, select Notification Service Extension and click Next. Give it a name you like, here we soberly chose NotificationServiceExtension. Choose the same team as your application target. Make sure that it is linked to your project instead of CordovaLib, and next that it's embedded in your application. Click Finish. XCode will ask you whether you want to activate the new scheme. Click Cancel. If you inadvertently clicked Activate, simply select your application in the scheme selector next to the run/stop buttons. Let's fix a signing issue: In the Project navigator, select your project. Select your new target. In the General tab, under Signing select your Team if necessary. Make sure the extension runs on any iOS 10.0 or ulterior devices: In the Project navigator, select your project. Select your new target. In the General tab, under Deployment Info set Deployment Target to 10.0. Add the necessary WonderPushExtension framework to the target: In the Project navigator, select your project. Select your new target. In the General tab, under Linked Frameworks and Libraries click the + button. Click Add Other…. Navigate to your project root directory then under platforms/ios/MyApp/Plugins/wonderpush-cordova-sdk/ and select WonderPushExtension.framework. Click Open. Let's fix a path issue: In the Project navigator, select your project. Select your new target. In the Build settings tab, under Search Paths on the Framework Search Paths line, double click on the cell with bold text (potentially on a green background). In the values list, find $(PROJECT_DIR)/YourApp/Plugins/wonderpush-cordova-sdk and drop $(PROJECT_DIR)/ at the beginning so it becomes Yourapp/Plugins/wonderpush-cordova-sdk. Click outside the popup to validate your input. (Pressing Enter then Escape to close the popup dismisses your changes.) Now we'll need to remove a Cordova configuration that leaks from the application's target to the extension target: In the Project navigator, select your project. Select your new target. In the Build settings tab, under Signing on the Code Signing Entitlements group, double click the cell corresponding to your extension target and remove values for both the Debug and Release entries so that they are empty. We're done with the configuration, now on with a bit of code. You should see the following files in your Project navigator: YourApp NotificationServiceExtension (this is the name of the service extension you chose earlier) NotificationService.h NotificationService.m Info.plist We are going to remove almost all generated code to rely on a utility class the implements it all for you. Open NotificationService.h and modify it so that it reads: #import &lt;WonderPushExtension/NotificationServiceExtension.h&gt; // We delegate everything to WPNotificationService @interface NotificationService : WPNotificationService @endThen open NotificationService.m and modify it so that it reads: #import &quot;NotificationService.h&quot; @implementation NotificationService // The WPNotificationService superclass already implements everything @endTest that cordova can still build your project from command-line: cordova buildIf you see an error in the step Check dependencies for the Notification Service Extension target, then open platforms/ios/cordova/build.xcconfig and add // at the begining of the following line so that it reads: // (CB-11854) //CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = $(PROJECT_DIR)/$(PROJECT_NAME)/Entitlements-$(CONFIGURATION).plistNow your project builds fine with either Cordova CLI or XCode. Troubleshooting missing media attachmentsWe have noticed that, after running an application using XCode, when running with Cordova after that can lead to media attachments not being shown in the notifications. The error that you can see in your device logs is as follows: (NB: not your application logs, open XCode, menu Window, click Devices and Simulators, choose your device and in the bottom of the main part, click the upward triangle in a square whose tooltip reads Show the device console) kernel(Sandbox)[0] &lt;Notice&gt;: SandboxViolation: NotificationServ(4385) deny(1) file-write-create /private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/PluginKitPlugin/73E48A8F-696D-460C-AEB8-BD83674DD158 NotificationServiceExtension(Foundation)[4385] &lt;Info&gt;: Write options: 0 -- URL: &lt;private&gt; -- purposeID: DCB02E0E-CA64-41B9-B99D-D37BC87C6A2E filecoordinationd(Foundation)[179] &lt;Notice&gt;: Received claim &lt;private&gt; filecoordinationd(Foundation)[179] &lt;Info&gt;: Starting to observe state of client with pid 4385 on behalf of claim DEA8C7A2-5479-4822-8586-A49E26FB214F filecoordinationd(Foundation)[179] &lt;Notice&gt;: Claim DEA8C7A2-5479-4822-8586-A49E26FB214F granted in server filecoordinationd(Foundation)[179] &lt;Notice&gt;: Claim DEA8C7A2-5479-4822-8586-A49E26FB214F invoked in server NotificationServiceExtension(Foundation)[4385] &lt;Notice&gt;: Claim DEA8C7A2-5479-4822-8586-A49E26FB214F granted in client NotificationServiceExtension(Foundation)[4385] &lt;Notice&gt;: Claim DEA8C7A2-5479-4822-8586-A49E26FB214F invoked in client filecoordinationd(Foundation)[179] &lt;Notice&gt;: Claim DEA8C7A2-5479-4822-8586-A49E26FB214F was revoked NotificationServiceExtension(WonderPushExtension)[4385] &lt;Notice&gt;: [WonderPush] Failed to write attachment to disk: Error Domain=NSCocoaErrorDomain Code=4 &quot;The folder \\M-b\\M^@\\M^\\0.jpg\\M-b\\M^@\\M^] doesn\\M-b\\M^@\\M^Yt exist.&quot; UserInfo={NSURL=file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/PluginKitPlugin/73E48A8F-696D-460C-AEB8-BD83674DD158/0.jpg, NSUnderlyingError=0x1762e4b0 {Error Domain=NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=2 &quot;No such file or directory&quot;}, NSUserStringVariant=Folder}While the actual cause is mysterious, the solution is simple: uninstall your application, and run it again using Cordova. 4) Use WonderPush SDK in your applicationa) Notification permission and SDK initializationOn iOS, you must call the cordova.plugins.WonderPush.setNotificationEnabled(true) function at some time, preferably after presenting the user what benefit will push notifications bring to him. The SDK initializes itself on the start of the application. You don't need to do anything. On Android it declares a custom Application class. If you already are using your own, be sure to call WonderPush.initialize(this); inside your implementation. On iOS it watches for the UIApplicationDidFinishLaunchingNotification notification in the NSNotificationCenter. b) Use WonderPush featuresSee our Cordova guide: Using the SDK in your Cordova application for guidance about using our features. These methods do the same thing as in the Android/iOS version: cordova.plugins.WonderPush.setUserId cordova.plugins.WonderPush.setNotificationEnabled cordova.plugins.WonderPush.trackEvent cordova.plugins.WonderPush.getInstallationCustomProperties cordova.plugins.WonderPush.putInstallationCustomProperties 5) Test your appcordova run --deviceUpdatingcordova plugin remove wonderpush-cordova-sdk cordova plugin add --save wonderpush-cordova-sdk --variable CLIENT_ID='id' --variable CLIENT_SECRET='secret' // OR for development cordova plugin add --save --link ../wonderpush-cordova-sdk --variable CLIENT_ID='id' --variable CLIENT_SECRET='secret'Recheck all integration steps, including for the Notification Service Extension, especially: Adding the necessary WonderPushExtension framework to the target Fix a path issue Advanced usageHandling your own deep linksWonderPush allows you to open a deep link with your notifications (targetUrl of your notification object, or set the tap/click action while composing your notification with our dashboard). To use deep links with cordova, you can use a plugin maintained by the community. × Search results Close "},"cordova.plugins.WonderPush.html":{"id":"cordova.plugins.WonderPush.html","title":"Namespace: WonderPush","body":" WonderPush Cordova SDK Namespaces cordova.plugins.WonderPush Namespace: WonderPush WonderPush Main object of the WonderPush SDK. Methods getAccessToken(cb) Returns the currently used access token. Returns null until the SDK is properly initialized. This together with your client secret gives entire control to the current installation and associated user, you should not disclose it unnecessarily. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~NullableStringCallback Callback called with the current access token, which may be null. getDeviceId(cb) Returns the unique device identifier Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~StringCallback Callback called with the current deviceId. getInstallationCustomProperties(cb) Returns the latest known custom properties attached to the current installation object stored by WonderPush. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~ObjectCallback Callback called with the current installation custom properties. getInstallationId(cb) Returns the installationId identifying your application on a device, bond to a specific userId. If you want to store this information on your servers, keep the corresponding userId with it. Will return null until the SDK is properly initialized. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~NullableStringCallback Callback called with the current installationId, which may be null. getNotificationEnabled(cb) Returns whether the notifications are enabled. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~BooleanCallback Callback called with either true or false. getPushToken(cb) Returns the push token. Returns null if the user is not opt-in. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~NullableStringCallback Callback called with the push token, which may be null. getUserId(cb) Returns the userId currently in use, null by default. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~NullableStringCallback Callback called with the current userId, which may be null. isReady(cb) Whether the SDK is ready to operate. The SDK is ready when it is initialized and has fetched an access token. Parameters: Name Type Description cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~BooleanCallback Callback called with true if the SDK is ready, false otherwise. putInstallationCustomProperties(customProperties [, cb]) Updates the custom properties attached to the current installation object stored by WonderPush. In order to remove a value, use null. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description customProperties object The partial object containing only the custom properties to update. The keys should be prefixed according to the type of their values. You can find the details in the Concepts &gt; Custom fields section of the documentation. cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~SuccessCallback &lt;optional&gt; The success callback. setLogging(enabled [, cb]) Controls native SDK logging. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description enabled boolean Whether to enable logs. cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~SuccessCallback &lt;optional&gt; The success callback. setNotificationEnabled(enabled [, cb]) Activates or deactivates the push notification on the device (if the user accepts for iOS) and registers the device token with WondePush. On iOS, you must call the following method at least once to make the user pushable. You can call this method multiple times. The user is only prompted for permission by iOS once. Calling with true opts the user in, whether he was not opt-in or soft opt-out (by calling with false). There is no need to call this method if the permission has already been granted, but it does not harm either. If the permission has been denied on iOS, calling this method cannot opt the user back in as iOS leaves the user in control, through the system settings. Because in iOS you only have one chance for prompting the user, you should find a good timing for that. For a start, you can systematically call it when the application starts, so that the user will be prompted directly at the first launch. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description enabled boolean The new activation state of push notifications. cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~SuccessCallback &lt;optional&gt; The success callback. setUserId(userId [, cb]) Sets the user id, used to identify a single identity across multiple devices, and to correctly identify multiple users on a single device. If not called, the last used user id it assumed. Defaulting to null if none is known. Upon changing userId, the access token is wiped, so avoid unnecessary calls, like calling with null just before calling with a user id. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description userId string &lt;nullable&gt; The user id, unique to your application. Use null for anonymous users. You are strongly encouraged to use your own unique internal identifier. cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~SuccessCallback &lt;optional&gt; The success callback. trackEvent(type [, data] [, cb]) Send an event to be tracked to WonderPush. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description type string The event type, or name. Event types starting with an @ character are reserved. data object &lt;optional&gt; &lt;nullable&gt; An object containing custom properties to be attached to the event. Prefer using a few custom properties over a plethora of event type variants. The keys should be prefixed according to the type of their values. You can find the details in the Concepts &gt; Custom fields section of the documentation. cb cordova.plugins.WonderPush~SuccessCallback &lt;optional&gt; The success callback. Type Definitions BooleanCallback(value) This callback is called with a single boolean argument when the call succeeds. Parameters: Name Type Description value boolean The return value. NullableStringCallback(value) This callback is called with a single nullable string argument when the call succeeds. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description value string &lt;nullable&gt; The return value. ObjectCallback(value) This callback is called with a single object argument when the call succeeds. Parameters: Name Type Description value object The return value. StringCallback(value) This callback is called with a single string argument when the call succeeds. Parameters: Name Type Description value string The return value. SuccessCallback() This callback is called with no argument when the call succeeds. × Search results Close "}}
